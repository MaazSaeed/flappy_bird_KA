Another Flappy Bird clone that I recently made as a small little fun project on KhanAcademy's JS editor.
Extra things added are sound, GUI, aesthetics and improved overall performance and feel of the game for a fun gameplay experience.
You can try the game [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/flappy-bird/5954086264946688) and create a spin off it too. (:
